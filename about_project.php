<p>The Art Project is a unique collaboration with some of the world’s most acclaimed art institutions to enable people to discover and view artworks online in extraordinary detail. Working with over 250 institutions, we have put tens of thousands of works of art from more than 6,000 artists online. This involved taking a selection of super high resolution images of famous artworks, as well as collating more than thirty thousand other images into one place. It also included building 360 degree tours of individual galleries using Street View ‘indoor’ technology. The project has expanded dramatically since it first launched. More than 45,000 objects are now available to view in high resolution, an increase from 1,000 in the first version. Street View images now cover over 60 museums, with more on the way.</p>
